The battleships game works well, Opponent shots back, all logic tests pass, can place the ships well with errors coming on if 
you double tap or overlap. however there was a few minor things i couldnt have done in time which would have made it better 
such as showing that the game is finished, a button to rotate the ships and a better opponent that would hit at 
neighbouring cells and most of the code is there just doesnt work right
